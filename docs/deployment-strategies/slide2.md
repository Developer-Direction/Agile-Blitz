# Overview of Deployment Strategies

1. Blue-Green Deployment
   - Definition: Two identical environments, with only one serving production traffic at a time.
   - High-Level Example: Deploy a new version to the green environment, then switch traffic from blue to green.
   - Advantages: Reduces downtime and risk by facilitating immediate rollback.
   - Disadvantages: Requires double the resources to maintain two environments.

2. Rolling Deployment
   - Definition: Gradual rollout of updates across servers or pods without downtime.
   - High-Level Example: Update a web application across multiple servers, one at a time.
   - Advantages: Minimizes downtime and allows for monitoring of the deployment process.
   - Disadvantages: Longer deployment time and potential for temporary inconsistency in service.

3. Canary Deployment
   - Definition: Releasing a new version to a small subset of users before a full rollout.
   - High-Level Example: Deploy a new feature to 5% of users initially, then gradually increase.
   - Advantages: Reduces risk by affecting a small user base and allows for user feedback.
   - Disadvantages: Requires complex deployment management and monitoring.

4. Feature Toggles
   - Definition: Use of feature flags to enable or disable functionality.
   - High-Level Example: Toggle a new feature on for beta testers while keeping it off for other users.
   - Advantages: Flexibility in controlling feature release and easy rollback.
   - Disadvantages: Can lead to code complexity and technical debt if not managed properly.

5. A/B Testing Deployment
   - Definition: Deploying two or more versions to compare different functionalities or designs.
   - High-Level Example: Test two different homepage designs to see which performs better.
   - Advantages: Data-driven decision making and user-centric development.
   - Disadvantages: Requires significant user traffic for statistical significance and can be resource-intensive.
